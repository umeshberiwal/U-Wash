# U-Wash
U Wash is an innovative project based on automation. We developed a U Wash smartphone application and washing machine circuit for controlling washing machines from anywhere. We modified a Voltas beko top loading washing machine with our circuit and controlled it with our mobile application. This technology successfully executed on this machine. Major problems with today's fully automatic washing machines are preset options like Auto, Normal, Quick, Heavy etc. Presets options have fixed water level and washing time which takes a lot of time and water for washing clothes. 

# Working 
Connect Washing machine with power supply and Run U Wash application on smartphone, Press and hold start button and Select water level and again press and hold start button and Select Time wherein you want to wash clothes. After that Select washing options like Soaking, Wash, Rinse and Spin. Again press and hold the start button when the start button goes to red then release the Start button and look at the Washing machine, WaterFilling process starts. If Washing machine won't connect with the wifi then the U Wash application gives
notification. After the clothes washing process is completed it also gives notification and tells us by speaking also that washing clothes is completed.
